Abolitionist Engineering is an open-source community started by software engineer and critical tech researcher <a href="http://www.nikkistevens.com">Nikki Stevens</a>.  Through AE, we are building practices of software engineering that are aligned with abolitoinist approaches to problem solving and world building.  

We believe:
- that writing code is practice of creative problem solving and world building
- that software can have a powerful impact on the communities we live in
- that software can contribute to better and more livable words
- that all of us can be a part of that contribution
- that the creativity of abolition is a good match for the creativity of software
